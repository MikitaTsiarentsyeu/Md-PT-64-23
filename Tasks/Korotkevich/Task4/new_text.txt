The February TIOBE Index of the most
popular   programming  languages  is
out,  and while the work going on in
the background of TIOBE calculations
has changed, not much has shifted in
the    way    of   rankings.  Python
continues  to  sit  atop  the index,
with  C and Java directly behind it.
In   Feb.  2021,  those  three  also
occupied  the  top  spot,  but  with
Python in the number three position,
C  at top, and Java in second place.
Beyond  the  top three, there hasn’t
been  much  movement  in  the index,
with  positions  four  through eight
unchanged  from  the  same time last
year.   Those  slots  are  occupied,
respectively,  by  C++,  C#,  Visual
Basic, JavaScript and PHP. Positions
nine  and 10 swapped from Feb. 21 to
now,  with Assembly Language and SQL
now     occupying    each    other’s
positions.  The one big move of note
between  Feb. 2021 and Feb. 2022 was
with    the    Groovy    programming
language,      an    object-oriented
language  for  Java. Over the course
of  the  year, Groovy fell from 12th
position    all  the  way  to  20th,
putting  it  perilously close to the
“other  programming languages” list.
TIOBE  CEO  Paul  Jansen  attributes
Groovy’s  decline  to  the growth in
the CI/CD space. Groovy was the only
language used for writing scripts on
Jenkins,  which  Jansen describes as
having been “the only real player in
the  CI/CD  domain”  early  on. Now,
with  platforms  that  don’t require
Groovy,  like  GitHub,  Azure DevOps
and  GitLab,  Groovy  is  losing its
place        at        the    table.
